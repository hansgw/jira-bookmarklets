# JIRA bookmarklets

These bookmarklets (JavaScript code inside a browser bookmark) extract frequently needed information from websites of Atlassian's issue system JIRA.
You can get information from your JIRA tickets manually (copy-paste, copy-paste, etc.) or use these bookmarklets instead and safe some tedious clicks.

### Prerequisites

* You need access to a JIRA project.
* These scripts work (tested) in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

### Installing

1. Copy the JavaScript code from on of the .js files here.
1. Create a new bookmark in your browser preferably in the toolbar and give it the same name as the file you just copied the code from.
1. Paste the JavaScript code into the URL field of the new bookmark.
1. Save the new bookmark.
1. How to use the bookmarklet? Read the instructions in the topmost code comment of the particular .js file.

The easiest way to create a bookmarklet in Internet Explorer is to copy it via drag'n'drop from Firefox. Really!
